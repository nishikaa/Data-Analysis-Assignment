## Stakeholder Summary Message

Hi team,

As part of the data assessment, I reviewed three datasets: user data, transaction data, and product data. Here's a quick overview of key findings:

### üîç Data Quality Observations:
- **Missing Values**: The `LANGUAGE` field in user data and several `CATEGORY_*` columns in product data contain missing values. `CATEGORY_4` has less than 20% coverage and may not be reliable for analysis.
- **Duplicate Records**: Transaction and product datasets contain duplicate rows (171 and 215 respectively) which need to be cleaned before analysis.
- **Inconsistent Formats**: Dates are stored as strings and required conversion. The `BARCODE` field is stored as float and may lose precision.

### üìà Interesting Trend:
Millennials show significantly higher spending in the **Health & Wellness** category compared to other generations.  
Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the sales percentage by generation:

| Generation  | Health & Wellness Sales |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| Millennials | 39,215.44                |
| Gen X       | 21,219.41                |
| Boomers     | 18,104.80                |
| Other       | *Insufficient data*      |

This insight may inform targeted marketing strategies or product recommendations.

### ‚ùìOutstanding Questions / Request for Action:
- **Product Category and Brand Data Gaps**: The `CATEGORY_1` through `CATEGORY_4` fields suggest a hierarchy of product types, but their exact meaning is unclear. Additionally, data coverage drops sharply by the time we reach `CATEGORY_4`, which has less than 20% usable data.  
  Moreover, the `BRAND` field ‚Äî which is critical for brand-level analysis ‚Äî has over 20% missing values. Improving coverage and documentation in both these areas would enable more confident analysis of brand performance and category trends.
- **Missing Demographics**: Additional fields like income level or loyalty program status (if available) could help better define "power users."
- **Data Dictionary**: A full data dictionary or field description document would significantly reduce ambiguity.

Let me know if there‚Äôs anything else I can provide to support this!

Best,  
Nishika
